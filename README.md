# nasm_vec_search
work in progress


This repo endeavors to create a netwide-assembler executable. Vector search is increasingly popular and it is built on very basic math. This is my attempt to make it more environmentally friendly. It doesn't work yet.

To compile, you'll need the nasm compiler. I did sudo apt install nasm and it installed on my system.
